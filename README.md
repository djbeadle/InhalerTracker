### What does it do?
It records when you use your inhaler and how many puffs of it you take.

### Where is the privacy policy?

### How does it do that?
You have to enter in when and how many puffs you take, but we're working on a bluetooth equipped inhaler that will do that for you<sup>1</sup>

### What kind of inhaler?
Whatever kind you want. Unfortunately Apple's HealthKit framework doesn't have the ability to differentiate between different types of inhalers.

### Why would you want to do that?
It's good to know how often you're taking your inhaler so you can tell if it's an effective solution for you. (This app will not tell you that)

### What else does it do?
Nothing! :)

### Where does my data go?
Straight into Apple HealthKit on your device, nowhere else.

This app does not do any of the following things with your data:
- Store it
- Transmit it
- Judge it
- Perform machine learning<sup>2</sup> on it
- Write to a blockchain

### TODO:
- Add a dark mode âœ…
- Add a today widget
- Graduate undergrad
- Get a job

<sup>1</sup> Just kidding, but I'm sure someone else is.

<sup>2</sup> Oh, that'd be a good #TODO item.
